## To Run:

For Windows users: Please run the `host.bat` file

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

## Controls:
`q and e` - Aiming left and right respectively
`h` - Hitting the ball (Selecting the power and angle of the ball's trajectory)
`r` - Quick restart

## Gameplay:
The scorebaord on the top left displays how many targets have been hit for the current level (red = not hit, green = hit).

When hitting the ball, the first input of `h` determines the angle of the hit, while the second will determine its power, with a higher slider on the "power meter" meaning a higher power.
